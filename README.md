RAD Studio Version Insight

This is actually a copy from:  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/radstudioverins/  
Here the master has been reset to the SourceForge's "plus" branch.

Compilation and installation instructions:
 
1. From Delphi, open the group project DelphiSvnXXX.groupproj 
  * XXX would correspond to your version of Delphi  
    * 200 = Delphi XE6
2. Choose to build all and install the design time packages (the last four in the group are design time packages)
3. For Git and Hg support, add the paths to Git.exe and Hg.exe by going to Tools -> Options -> Version Control -> [Git | Mercurial]

The installer **here** is not yet operational
