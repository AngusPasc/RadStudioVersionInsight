Compilation and installation instructions:
1.) From Delphi, open the group project DelphiSvnXXX.groupproj
  XXX would corespond to your version of Delphi

2.) Choose to build all and install the design time packages (the last four in the group are design time packages)
3.) For Git and Hg support, add the paths to Git.exe and Hg.exe by going to Tools -> Options -> Version Control -> [Git | Mercurial]
